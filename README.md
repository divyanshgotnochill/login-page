->Login page âœ… 

Built a simple User login page that is built with the help of HTML&CSS. 

I took reference from the Login page project of Codehal. I learnt some new properties of CSS from their wonderful video tutorial.

In addition, I added a hover animation and active feature on the login button.

Key Points :

->Hover animations

->On clicking animations

->Translucent login section
